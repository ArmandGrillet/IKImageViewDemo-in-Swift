IKImageViewDemo in Swift
========================

![Project's image](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/armand.gr/static/work/IKImageViewDemo+in+Swift/GitHub.png)

##Why?

[IKImageViewDemo](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/samplecode/IKImageViewDemo/Introduction/Intro.html) is a popular sample code provided by Apple to create a simple image editor. The code has not been translated in Swift officially so I did it myself. The goal of this project is to be a good way to see how to write real apps in Swift by comparing the code.

##What?

This is a simple translation, Controller.m is now Controller.swift and... that's it.

##Can I use it?

Of course! This project is under MIT license.

###"IKImageViewDemo in Swift" or "IKImageViewDemo 2014"?
"IKImageViewDemo in Swift" is the project's name but Xcode is not the best tool to rename folders.
