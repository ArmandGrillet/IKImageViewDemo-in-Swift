IKImageViewDemo in Swift
========================

##Why?

[IKImageViewDemo](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/samplecode/IKImageViewDemo/Introduction/Intro.html) is a popular sample code provided by Apple to create a simple image editor. The code has not been translated in Swift officially so I did it by myself.

##What?

This is a simple translation, Controller.m is now Controller.swift and... that's it. No functionalities has been added, the goal of this project is to be a good way to see how to write real apps in Swift by comparing the code.

##Can I use it?

Of course! This project is under MIT license.
